Mitral insufficiency is a major problem of the heart where surgery is required. This project aims to automatically segment the mitral valve of the heart using Deep Learning, with the 3D U-Net architecture.

## Multi-modal registration

Without going into specific details about the project, let me talk about multi-modal 3D registration which is applicable to a wide variety of applications.

There are a few broad categories of registration based on the assumptions we make about the two volumes.

### Rigid Registration

When we assume that these volumes are rigid, then what we are doing is a simple *affine transform* of one of the volumes - which is essentially composed of elementary operations such as rotation, translation, scaling and shearing. This kind of registration basically moves the volume in space in a way that preserves lines and doesn't *warp* or *deform* the volume.

#### Implementation

Affine registration can be implemented through the modules **RegistrationManual** or **AffineTransformation3D** modules in MevisLab.

*There is a major caveat in terms of co-ordinate systems, which is crucial to performing registration in medical volumes. I will explain that in further sections.*

### Elastic Registration

*Elastic* or *Deformable* registration is more representative of how the two medical volumes are related. This is because, there are motion and breathing artefacts from the patient that require a non-uniform mapping between the images. In contrast to affine registration which is a global transform - meaning, the entire volume was transformed by the same parameters; deformable registration is a local transform that acts on local patches of the image. This is performed by computing a vector field. One way to do this is the Demon's algorithm, from Euler-Lagrangian based regularisation methods (ðŸš¨ *Hardcore math alert* ðŸš¨).

Generally, when we have two medical volumes, rigid registration is applied first - to sort of understand the global transformation, after which it is made more accurate by elastically deforming the volume.

#### Implementation

Deformable registration can be implemented in MeVisLab using the **ImageWarp** module.

### Co-ordinate Systems

This is a common pitfall when working with registration. If you aren't aware of the different co-ordinate systems you are most likely to spend (waste) a lot of time trying to figure out why things don't fit together. So it would do you a lot of good to equip yourself with this knowledge before-hand.

I am planning to write a separate blog-post outlining the problems I faced, but until then here is a great link that elucidates this concept in medical scenarios:
