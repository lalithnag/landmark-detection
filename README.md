# Landmark detection in echocardiography

The mitral valve is a valve in the heart, which contains two leaflets, an annulus which forms a ring around the valve leaflet and the papillary muscles which keep everything together. A malfunction of the mitral valve can cause many heart disorders and *valvular* diseases. In some cases, surgery is required to fix these problems. This is quite a daunting task, as the surgeons have a restricted view of this heart valve, especially via an Ultrasound image. This is where an automatic segmentation of the valve using CNN's can play a pivotal role in drastically improving the quality of surgical decisions.

## CNN's

Convolutional Neural Networks can be used for segmentation of medical structures, when adequate expert data is provided. This project uses a U-Net architecture to segment the mitral valve.

## General Note

Since this project is a *work in progress*, I haven't yet uploaded any code snippets or basically gone into any kind of detail yet :no_mouth:. But, rest assured I will soon. Keep checking this space for more information.
