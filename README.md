# Landmark detection in echocardiography

## CNN's

Convolutional Neural Networks can be used for segmentation of medical structures, when adequate expert data is provided. This project uses a U-Net architecture to segment the mitral valve.

## General Note

Since this project is a *work in progress*, I haven't uploaded any code snippets or basically gone into any kind of detail yet :no_mouth:. But, rest assured I will soon. Keep checking this space for more information.
